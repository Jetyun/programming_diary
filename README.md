#What I found out today

######8/11/2023

1. 1.I found out that multiplication is better than division in this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/GFO_txvwK_c?si=rO0s0J694DVI0q6d) in 2.28.34 timeStamp. This is answered and upvoted in [stackoverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10535605/javascript-performance-divide-or-multiply-vs). |not tested|
2. The [tutorial](https://youtu.be/GFO_txvwK_c?si=rO0s0J694DVI0q6d) in 2.28.34 timeStamp also mentioned that when using for loop it is faster to use pre-incrementation(++i) than post-incrementation(I--)
